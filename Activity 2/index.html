				<p>
				I am a Management Information Systems student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha with a minor in Computer Science. I have also been Interning at Interpublic Group (IPG) since July of 2014. I intend to graduate college after the fall semester of this year. Before college I graduated from Lutheran High Northeast in Norfolk, Nebraska. In my free time I enjoy reading, playing video games, and weight lifting.
